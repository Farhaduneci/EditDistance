Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.

This application calculates the required operations and also prints them:

> Demo:

Enter Start String: Farhad
Enter Ending String: Farzad
Edit Distance between `Farhad` and `Farzad` is: 2

Operations performed are:
 Operations on Start String:
   Char 'F' -> No Operation
   Char 'a' -> No Operation
   Char 'r' -> No Operation
   Char 'h' -> Substitution
   Char 'a' -> No Operation
   Char 'd' -> No Operation

 Operations on Ending String:
   Char 'F' -> No Operation
   Char 'a' -> No Operation
   Char 'r' -> No Operation
   Char 'z' -> Substitution
   Char 'a' -> No Operation
   Char 'd' -> No Operation
